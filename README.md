PROJECT SUMMARY

The project that I worked on during the 30 days DLITHE Internship program is "OFFICE CARE SOLUTION".

The components used for the implementation of the project are:
1. Arduino Uno board
2. Breadboards
3. Ultrasonic sensors (2)
4. Servo motors (3)
5. LEDs (Red and green)
6. Piezo or Buzzer

Working:
The setup consists of a Glassdoor to welcome the guests/customers into the office, a sanitizer dispenser and a passgate to allow the customers to enter the office area.

When a customer approaches the Glassdoor at the entrance, the ultrasonic sensor present at the door detects the presence of the incoming customer and opens the door to welcome him/her. A servo motor is used to open/close the door.

The next stage of the setup is the sanitizer dispenser. A servo motor attached to the dispensing machine automatically dispenses sanitizer when the customer holds his/her palm close to the dispenser. The detection of palm is achieved using another ultrasonic sensor configured to suitable distance of detection.

Once the sanitizer is dispensed the system waits for a few seconds for the customer to apply sanitizer on his hands and the passgate is opened for 3 seconds along with a green LED blinking thrice for the customer to enter the office area. Once the customer enters, the passgate closes; indicated by a long buzz and a red LED.
